Welcome to the user information page for RIGR.  
**60% fewer features, resonance-invariant, and delivering the same high performance!**

RIGR is introduced and discussed in our work: **RIGR: Resonance Invariant Graph Representation for Molecular Property Prediction**([paper](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jcim.5c00495), [preprint](https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-qgfxp-v2)). It is  designed to impose resonance invariance for molecular property prediction tasks and is accesible as a featurizer in [**Chemprop v2**](https://github.com/chemprop/chemprop) (available in versions 2.1.2 and above).

- **For CLI users**: RIGR is available as a choice for the multi-hot atom featurization scheme. To use RIGR, add the following argument to your training or inference script.
   ```bash
   --multi-hot-atom-featurizer-mode RIGR
   ```
   This sets the atom and bond feature set to be resonance invariant and applies to both non-reaction and reaction featurization. See an example bash script [here](https://github.com/akshatzalte/chemprop/blob/rigr_home/examples/hpopt_train_predict_rigr.sh). If required, the overall molecular charge descriptor can be added to the learned embedding by using `--molecule-featurizer charge`.

    **NOTE**: Ensure consistent featurization scheme for train, predict, and hpopt.

- **For Jupyter Notebook users**: Refer to our [example notebook](https://github.com/chemprop/chemprop/blob/main/examples/rigr_featurizer.ipynb) to use RIGR in a notebook environment.

## RIGR Featurizer

RIGR ensures a unified graph representation of different resonance structures of the same molecule, including non-equivalent resonance forms. By using RIGR, users can avoid manually selecting a specific resonance form for molecules or radicals exhibiting resonance. If you find RIGR helpful in your research, please cite our [paper](https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-qgfxp).

RIGR uses only the subset of atom and bond features from Chemprop that remain invariant across different resonance forms. The tables below indicate which atom and bond features are present and absent in RIGR.
